                    <h1> Start of this website </h1>
                    <h3> The domain name </h3>
                    <p>
                        For the past few months I had been thinking of getting my own domain name. I was deciding both on the TLD (top-level domain, the part on the right side of a domain, like <i>.com</i>), and on the SLD (second-level domain, the part to the left of the <i>.com</i>). I had no intention of going after a <i>.com</i> (because those are really expensive). Instead I wanted one of the newer TLDs that are cheaper and less common. I saw the <i>.dev</i> TLD and it immediately appealed to the software <i>developer</i> part of my being. I'm sure lots of developers had the same experience.

                        I wanted a domain name that was simple and short. The three letter TLD <i>.dev</i> was a great start. As for the SLD, I wanted something short also. If this is supposed to be a personal website, why not my own last name? It would be <i>weel.dev</i>, and it seemed perfect! Unfortunately, it was already taken.

                        I proceeded to try some combinations of my last name with either my first name or just first letters, and eventually found the acceptable combination <i>jweel.dev</i>. The pattern first letter + last name is quite common across multiple industries, especially for stuff like business accounts. Therefore, <i>jweel</i> was already familiar to me. It is used by my employer for my company email address, and it is my screen name on GitHub.

                        It was then that the domain registrar told me to watch out, because <i>jweel</i> could be seen as a typo for <i>jewel</i>. Queue existential crisis. My name is just a typo for <i>jewel</i>? Am I in the wrong industry? This set me back months. I gave up and forgot about buying a domain.

                        But then, on a whim months later, I looked up <i>weel.dev</i> again, and was surprised to find it now available. Twelve bucks for a year? Sure, sign me up. And that's how I got my own domain name.
                    </p>
                    <h3> The website </h3>
                    <p>
                        So I bought the domain name, but now what? Obviously I had to find some way to use it. I found that my domain registrar would let me forward arbitrary email addresses ending on <i>weel.dev</i> to my actual email address. I set it up and tested it out. It did not work. It sent correctly but I never received it. Turns out some email providers will automatically ignore emails in the inbox if they are sent from the same address. Makes sense, but no one ever told me that.

                        But I needed to do more. It was almost midnight, my wife had gone to sleep, why not hack together a little website? I knew web development is dramatically different now than how it was 10 years ago, when I learned some in college. Sure, I work on web applications and even setting up web infrastructure in my professional career, but doing everything from scratch is a different ball game. It is also, nowadays at least, an extremely simple and straightforward ball game.

                        I was trying to figure out how to get SSL certification when I saw that there are platforms where you can host static content for free. Just install <i>node</i>, download some scripts, use them to push some html, and done! Next put in the custom domain name, and let the domain registrar know, and sit tight. It said I had to wait up to 24 hours. It only took 5 minutes. My website was live. And apart from the domain name, it's all free.

                        Personal website is up. Write a quick blog article, upload, and call it a day. See you next time.
